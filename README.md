- The following variables vehicle_length and ground_clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset because their Pr was greater than the p-value of 5.35e-11.
- The p-Value for the model is 5.35e-11, which is 5.35 x 10 ^-11 or equal to 0.0000000000535. Therefore, since the p-value is much smaller than the significance level of 0.05%, there is sufficient evidence to reject our mull hypothesis, and indicates the slope of the linear model is not 0.
- The linear model has a value of .6825 for the r-squared, which means about 68% of all mpg predictions can be determined by this model. Therfore, this multiple regression model does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Based on the total statistics for suspension coils, the results show that MechaCar design specifications are being met because the variance is about 62, which is less than 100 pounds per square inch.

Based on the lot total statistics for suspension coils, the results show that MechaCar design specifications are being met for only lots 1 and 2, which variances of lot 1 are .98 and lot 2 are 7.5 are significantly under 100 pounds per square inch. Lot 3 is an outlier because the variance is 170 and the coils are not meeting design specifications.
