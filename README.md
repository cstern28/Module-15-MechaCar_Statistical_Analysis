- The following variables vehicle_length and ground_clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset because their Pr was greater than the p-value of 5.35e-11.
- The p-Value for the model is 5.35e-11, which is 5.35 x 10 ^-11 or equal to 0.0000000000535. Therefore, since the p-value is much smaller than the significance level of 0.05%, there is sufficient evidence to reject our mull hypothesis, and indicates the slope of the linear model is not 0.
- The linear model has a value of .6825 for the r-squared, which means about 68% of all mpg predictions can be determined by this model. Therfore, this multiple regression model does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
